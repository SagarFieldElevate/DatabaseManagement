# DatabaseManagement

Automated scripts for AirTable database management.

## Directory Structure

Scripts are now organized by the frequency of the data they retrieve.

```
code/
  intraday/      - high frequency scripts (minutes, hours)
  daily/         - scripts fetching daily data
  weekly/        - scripts fetching weekly data
  monthly/       - scripts fetching monthly data
  quarterly/     - scripts fetching quarterly data
  yearly/        - scripts fetching yearly data
  event_driven/  - scripts that run around specific events
```

All scripts have been moved into these frequency folders. Older indicator
directories were removed to simplify navigation. Place any new scripts in
the folder that matches the data update frequency.
